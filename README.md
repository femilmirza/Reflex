# Memory Card Flip Game

A classic memory card flip game built with React, JSX, and useState. No external libraries are used. The game uses emoji pairs for cards, shuffles the layout, manages flip and match logic with useState, includes a reset button, and shows a congratulations message when all pairs are matched.

## How to Play

- Click on cards to flip them and find matching emoji pairs.
- If two flipped cards match, they stay revealed.
- If not, they flip back after a short delay.
- Match all pairs to win!
- Use the Reset button to start a new game.

   npm install
